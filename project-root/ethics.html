                    <h4>Responsible use in the academe</h4>

                    <p class="ethicSentence">Ateneo de Manila University has introduced a new policy to ensure the
                        ethical and responsible use
                        of AI, focusing on promoting transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI technologies used
                        within the university, while also addressing concerns such as data privacy, bias, and the
                        potential impact on employment and academic integrity
                    </p>

                    <h4>Avoiding Plagiarism & Misuse</h4>
                    <p class="ethicSentence">Ensuring originality begins with clearly distinguishing between
                        human-created and AI-generated
                        content. All AI-assisted outputs should be documented, verified, and rewritten in the user's own
                        voice before use. Proper attribution must be provided when referencing AI tools or external
                        sources, and institutional policies should be followed to prevent unintentional misuse. Regular
                        reviews and transparency in how AI is used help maintain academic and professional integrity.

                    <h4>Accuracy & verification of AI outputs</h4>
                    <p class="ethicSentence">AI-generated information must always be treated as a draft, not a final
                        source of truth.
                        Verification involves cross-checking facts with credible references, validating numerical data,
                        and ensuring the content aligns with current, real-world information. Human oversight is
                        essential—evaluators should review coherence, relevance, and completeness. Maintaining updated
                        evaluation criteria and applying critical judgment helps ensure the reliability and correctness
                        of AI-produced content.</p>

                    <h4>Bias and fairness</h4>
                    <p class="ethicSentence">AI systems can inherit biases from skewed training data or flawed model
                        structures, affecting
                        decisions in areas like hiring, lending, or categorization. Ethical usage requires awareness of
                        these potential biases, active identification of unfair patterns, and consistent testing for
                        discriminatory outcomes. Working with diverse datasets, applying bias-detection tools, and
                        maintaining transparency in how decisions are generated help support equitable and fair AI
                        practices.</p>

                    </a>
                    <h4>Accessibility and Inclusivity</h4>
                    <p class="ethicSentence">Ethical AI must be designed to serve users of different backgrounds,
                        abilities, and communities.
                        Achieving inclusivity requires building systems that are easy to use, culturally aware, and
                        accessible to individuals with disabilities. This includes considering language diversity,
                        assistive technologies, and user-centered design principles. Prioritizing marginalized groups
                        and assessing real-world accessibility gaps ensures that AI tools contribute to broader social
                        equity rather than reinforcing exclusion.</p>

                    <h4>Responsible AI Deployment</h4>
                    <p class="ethicSentence">Deploying AI responsibly means maintaining transparency in how systems
                        operate, protecting user
                        privacy, and ensuring the technology aligns with legal and ethical standards. Clear oversight
                        mechanisms, continuous monitoring, and regular updates help reduce risks such as misinformation,
                        misuse, or unintended harm. Organizations should act with accountability, documenting decisions,
                        and ensuring that AI systems remain safe, secure, and beneficial to all stakeholders.</p>

                    <h4>Ethical Collaboration with AI Developers</h4>
                    <p class="ethicSentence">Developers and organizations must work together with a shared commitment to
                        ethical AI design.
                        This includes establishing guidelines for fairness, transparency, and accountability, as well as
                        engaging in ongoing communication about risks, limitations, and societal impact. Ethical
                        collaboration encourages continuous improvement, diverse team perspectives, responsible data
                        handling, and a clear alignment with human rights. Through these practices, AI development
                        becomes both trustworthy and socially responsible.</p>
